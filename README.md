# mvo_android
The monocular visual odometry implemented on an Android phone.
### 1.Dependency
* Eclipse with ADT„ÄÅCDT;

* android-ndk-r10e(NDK);
* OpenCV4Android 3.0.0 or 3.1.0;

  [Here to download OpenCV4Android](http://opencv.org/downloads.html)

  The KITTI benchmark data* is used for MVO test.    
  *KITTI data is well known as benchmark data for computer vision algorithm evaluation,it
  is available at http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/
